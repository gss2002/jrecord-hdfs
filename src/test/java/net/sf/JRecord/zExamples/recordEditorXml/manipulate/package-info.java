/**
 * This package holds examples of reading in a Cobol Copybook, updating the copybook
 * and writing the Copybook out as a Xml-Copybook (or schema). 
 * 
 * <p>The uses for this process include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Create a <i>matching</i> Csv schema for use in utility copy to Csv from Cobol
 *   or for use in writing the Csv file (using JRecord) that will be copies to Cobol.  
 *   <li>Rename Duplicate field names in the Cobol copybook. This can be useful in generic
 *   processing.
 *   <li>Adding extra information (e.g. FileStructure of Record-Parent information to the Cobol Copybook)
 *   and then writing it out as a Xml-Copybook (or schema)
 * </ul> 
 *
